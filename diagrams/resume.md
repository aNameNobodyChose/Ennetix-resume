## ðŸ›  Experience

**Ennetix â€“ Network Analytics and operations Engineer**  
*Date â€“ Present*
Let's try to take a simple example problem and identify the different infrastructural changes in order to achieve the goal.
PROBLEM: Flag all suspicious domains being accessed on your network.
Client side:
- Capturing all devices' traffic on our local network: Set up the local network with a Router âž” WLC âž” Port mirrored switch âž” Main Switch âž” APs. Thus, all traffic on our network is sent to the edge device. Full LAN diagram: https://github.com/aNameNobodyChose/Ennetix-resume/blob/main/diagrams/ennetix-port-mirror-pic.jpg.
- Extract all essential fields for the captured traffic: Created and deployed a dockerized agent written in c++ to extract important fields for further analysis(In our case: source and destination IP).
Server side:
The goal here is to create a network monitoring solution that represents on premisis to save on cloud costs.
- Deploy company's network monitoring solution: In order to deploy the company's network monitoring solution, I used kubeadm to deploy a Kubernetes cluster on premisis. 
- Architected and deployed a full-stack network monitoring solution (`xvisor`) on on-prem servers using Kubernetes (kubeadm).
- Designed the deployment pipeline using Terraform to manage Kafka, Spark, Elasticsearch, Logstash, Go backends, and Vue.js frontends as infrastructure-as-code.
- Built a custom port mirroring setup to capture live traffic into Dockerized `xources` (e.g., Zeek, PCAP processors) deployed on the `xome` edge device.
- Developed and containerized Spark Streaming jobs to consume Kafka topics, process network flows and security logs, and push enriched data into Elasticsearch.
- Engineered Go-based RESTful backend services querying Elasticsearch indices, integrated with a Vue.js frontend for real-time analytics.
- Leveraged Azure Container Registry for storing container images; integrated into the deployment workflow.
- Set up Kafka load balancers and ingress rules for scalable, resilient streaming architecture.
